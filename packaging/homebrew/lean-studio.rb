  caveats <<~EOS
    Lean Studio needs elan, Lean's toolchain manager. If you don't have it, Lean Studio
    offers to install it on first launch, or run:
      brew install elan-init

    Releases that are not yet notarized are blocked by Gatekeeper on first launch.
    If macOS says it cannot check the app, open System Settings > Privacy & Security
    and click "Open Anyway" for Lean Studio.
